# Mini-React-Shopping-App
Mini React shopping app is a simple website developed with React for practicing purposes. It has no backends or databases, so all data will be gone when refreshing the website. The website is running on https://limitless-wave-00654.herokuapp.com/. It has the following functions:
1. Submit your name, and you will get a warm greeting below the main title.
2. You can add items to and remove items from the shopping cart, and the total price will be calculated and shown on the website instantly.
3. You can filter the items by name, or just let the website show items in your shopping cart.
